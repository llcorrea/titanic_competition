# Titanic Competition - Machine Learning from Disaster

The competition goal consists in the use of ML to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the legendary Titanic shipwreck.

[Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

> In this code, I've done an exploratory data analysis and also implemented some ML models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, in order to better know the data and reach the competition goals.

# Titanic Competition - Machine Learning from Disaster

**The competition's goal consists in the use of Machine Learning (ML) to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the legendary Titanic shipwreck.**

> In this code, I've done an exploratory data analysis and also implemented some ML models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, in order to better know the problem data and meet the competition goals.
